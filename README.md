# Python-Learn-Test
Whatever I'm learning is added to this in a much more advanced way. Code is written in very simple and easy to read manner. Just test it and report bugs as usual. 

If you want you can use the section of the code or inspiration from the program and create something similar.
Suggestions for improvements and new abilities are always appreciated.
Only make changes in the features section.
If contribution is good enough then you'll get your own specialized response
